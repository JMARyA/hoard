# Hoard
This project aims to provide a simple and automated way of hoarding lots of data.
It provides a daemon which can be configured via a config file and download content from multiple sources.
It should automatically download new content as soon as it becomes available but not download content twice.
It will dump everything it finds into a directory from which you can organize the content in any way you see fit.
